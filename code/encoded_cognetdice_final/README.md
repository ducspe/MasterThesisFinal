# This code accompanies the master thesis "Decentralized Information Gathering with Continuous and very large Discrete Observation Spaces"
# It represents the version of the COGNet-DICE algorithm that works with images encoded by a Variational Autoencoder
# This version is promising for Transfer Learning because it trains the agent to be more robust to noise
# The algorithm makes use of many neural nets and therefore it is advisable to have a GPU enabled system

# Run "encoded_source_localization.py" to start COGNet-DICE on the encoded source localization problem
