# This code accompanies the master thesis "Decentralized Information Gathering with Continuous and very large Discrete Observation Spaces"
# It represents the baseline version of the COGNet-DICE algorithm that works with 1D continuous spaces
# The algorithm makes use of many neural nets and therefore it is advisable to have a GPU enabled system

# Run "source_localization_final.py" to start plain COGNet-DICE on the dynamic source localization problem
