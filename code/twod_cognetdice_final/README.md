# This code accompanies the master thesis "Decentralized Information Gathering with Continuous and very large Discrete Observation Spaces"
# It represents the version of the COGNet-DICE algorithm that works with 2D images
# The algorithm makes use of many neural nets and therefore it is advisable to have a GPU enabled system

# Run "twod_source_localization.py" to start 2D COGNet-DICE on the static source localization problem
